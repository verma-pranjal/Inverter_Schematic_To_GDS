# Inverter_Schematic_To_GDS
**Inverter_Schematic_To_GDS (45nm)**
This project demonstrates the complete Schematic-to-GDSII flow for a CMOS inverter using Cadence Virtuoso with the GPDK045 (45nm technology) library. It covers schematic design, simulation, layout, verification (DRC, LVS), parasitic extraction, and GDS generation.

**ðŸŽ¯ Objective**
To design and implement a CMOS inverter in 45nm technology, verify its layout against design rules and schematic, and generate a GDSII file suitable for fabrication.

ðŸ”§ Design Flow
1. Schematic Design
NMOS and PMOS connected in pull-down and pull-up configuration respectively.

Create symbol view for top-level usage and simulation.

2. Functional Simulation (Pre-layout)
Transient simulation using Spectre.

Verify logic functionality, propagation delay, rise/fall times.

3. Layout Design
Draw layout using GPDK045 rules.

Use appropriate layer assignments and transistor PCell generation.

4. DRC (Design Rule Check)
Run DRC via Assura .

Ensure there are 0 violations.

5. LVS (Layout vs Schematic)
Confirm the layout matches the schematic.

Pass LVS with net and device match.

6. Parasitic Extraction (RCX)
Use Assura RCX to extract parasitics.

Generate extracted view for post-layout simulation.

7. Post-Layout Simulation
Run transient simulation using the extracted view.

Measure impact of parasitics on delay and performance.

8. GDSII Generation
Export layout to GDSII using Cadence Virtuoso.

Ensure correct layer mapping file is used (e.g., gpdk045.tf, gpdk045.map).
